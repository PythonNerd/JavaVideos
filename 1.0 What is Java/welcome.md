Greetings, are you another adventurer on the journey to discover how to code? It's dangerous to go alone, so take our tutorials with you! In this video we will help you get to the HUB of your journies: *Eclipse*. This place has so much to offer a daring programmer. However before we set you up and let you loose in this open world, we have to explain what Java actually is!

Java is a high level programming language that is based around classes and is Object-Oriented, an important topic that we will go over in a few videos from now! Java runs on millions of devices using a 'Java Virutal Machine', which means that if one device has it installed, it can run Java programs made on any other device by running it through the JVM. Java was based on the C family of languages, along with a few other common ones in the 90s. 

But what is Java useful for? Business applications, Android applications, and even gaming systems use it! Java has a lot of useful features, but some programmers critize things that go on under the hood, which we will also discuss later! 

To start off, you willneed Eclipse. Head over to eclipse.org and click on Download. On the left side of the page you will see *Eclipse Neon* and it will say *Download 64 Bit*. Once you work through the installation, open up Eclipse.
